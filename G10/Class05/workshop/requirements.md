# Create an MVC structured eRestaurant application - part 01

1. - Create a dish resource and implement all the crud operations for it
     (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT/PATCH)
   - The price should be validated when updating or adding a dish, no prices above 1000 or below 1

   /get dishes
   /get dish by id
   /post dishes => create new dish
   /put dishes => going to accept a dish
   /delete dishes => remove a dish

   Dish {
   id: string,
   name: string,
   price: number,
   }

2. - Create an order resource and implemented all crud operations for it
   - Add a special patch endpoint that will only PATCH the status of an order (ex:PATCH orders/:id/:status)

     Order: {
     id: string,
     dishName: string,
     status: string (new, cancelled, done)
     }
     {
     id: '12"
     dishName: "chicken soup"
     status: "new"/"cancelled"/"done"
     }

- OPTIONAL BONUS
  When creating a new order check if the dishName exists in the dishes resource (think importing one model in another)

3. - Create auth model/controller that will allow users to log in (use express-session for auth)

User: {
id: string,
username: string,
password: string,
role: string (user, admin)
}

4. - Endpoints that should be available to users:
   - GET All dishes
   - GET Dish by id
   - POST Order (validate that one only one order is recieved in the body with a middleware)

5. - Endpoints available to admins:
   - All Dish Endpoints
   - All Order Endpoints

Guidelines:

- Everything above should be implemented using the MVC pattern (choose your own style of syntax).
- Finish one step before moving on to the next, the goal of this workshop is for you to do as much as you can in 3 hours, not to finish all the requirements, no rush.
- Test every endpoint in postman before moving on to the next, do not type them out in a batch.
- It is okay to reference and use code already implemented in class (ex: data.service.js).
- There is no need to create a frontend to consume these endpoints, focus on building the api.
- You shouldn't have extremely precise error handling but it should be implemented in a basic way for all endpoints.

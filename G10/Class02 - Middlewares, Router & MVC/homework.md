# Exercise

- Continue working on top of the application we've started on MVC Recap ( Booking App ), we have implemented only one GET route /hotels that returns the hotels in our DB.

Requirements of the homework:

- Create new POST route '/add_hotel', that is going to add new hotel into hotel.json.

- Create new json in db folder called "motels.json", and put some dummy data inside ( few motels with the same properties as the hotel ). Get inspired by hotels.json.

- Create new GET route '/motels' that is going to return the list of motels

- Create new POST route '/add_motel' that is going to add new motel to the motels.json

Keep following the MVC pattern (as we did in class) to implement the solutions =)

Happy hacking! ;)
